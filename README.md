<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Our team has just integrated the software publisher ProSoft.   
Under the responsibility of the CIO, we are in charge of managing the "EasySave" project which consists in developing a backup software.  
As any software of the ProSoft Suite, the software will be integrated into the pricing policy.  
- Unit price : 200 €HT 
- Annual maintenance contract 5/7 8-17h (updates included): 12% purchase price (Annual contract tacitly renewed with revaluation based on the SYNTEC index) 

During this project, we will have to ensure the development, the management of major and minor versions, but also the documentation (user and customer support).  
To ensure that our work can be taken over by other teams, we must work within certain constraints such as the tools used (see [Software restrictions](#built-with)).  

Release dates and versions :
* Version 1.0 : 25/11/2020
* Version 2.0 : 07/12/2020
* Version 3.0 : 17/12/2020
