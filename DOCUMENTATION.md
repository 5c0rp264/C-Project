### 1. Add a backup work

> If you want to make a backup later you will need a backup work. This section is designed to help you create one.
* First you need to tell us the name of the backup work you want to create, make it easy to identify it's goal easily !
* Then you must add the source destination like this : `C:\Users\YOUR NAME\Desktop\MySourceFolder`
* The destination where you want the backup to be made, it can be on an external drive, on a shared network or wherever you want it.
* Finally the type of backup : differential or full. A full backup will copy each and every files / folders while a differential one compares itself to a full and copy only modified files

### 2. Edit a backup work

> If you made any mistake or if you want to modify a backup work you will have to use this section to correct it. 
* You will first need to rewrite the name. Press <kbd>enter</kbd> to keep the previous one
* Then you will have to rewrite the source folder of the backup. Press <kbd>enter</kbd> to keep the previous one
